// this will be a search component that moves interactivity into the filter
// and pagination bars only. Note that as a result, overrides with interactivity
// (e.g. clickable buttons on rows of results) won't be possible
// with this kind of layout.

// all three layouts should comopose from HOCs by passing in appropriate
// stateful or stateless components for filter bar, pagination bar and column headers
